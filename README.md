# Installation 

for linux the command for cloning and using knightvim is 

```bash
cd ~/.config/
git clone https://github.com/justlookz/knightvim ~/.config/nvim
```

replace nvim for other name if wanted to use with
```text
$XDG_HOME_APP
```


# Disclamer
This is my personal configuration. 
Use it at your own risk.
