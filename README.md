# Installation 

for linux the command for cloning and using knightvim is 

```bash
cd ~/.config/
git clone https://github.com/justlookz/knightvim ~/.config/nvim
```

replace nvim for other name if wanted to use with
```text
$NVIM_APPNAME
```
by creating an alias
```bash
alias kvim='$NVIM_APPNAME="/name-of-folder kvim"
```
replace name-of-folder with whatever name 


# Disclamer
This is my personal configuration. 
Use it at your own risk.
